The goal of Pocket ID is to be a simple and easy-to-use. There are other self-hosted OIDC providers like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) or [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/) but they are often too complex for simple use cases.

Additionally, what makes Pocket ID special is that it only supports [passkey](https://www.passkeys.io/) authentication, which means you don’t need a password. Some people might not like this idea at first, but I believe passkeys are the future, and once you try them, you’ll love them. For example, you can now use a physical Yubikey to sign in to all your self-hosted services easily and securely.

## Setup

Pocket ID can be set up in multiple ways. The easiest and recommended way is to use Docker.
